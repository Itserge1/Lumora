# What's Lumora

Lumora is a financial news summarizer that collects relevant news for different ticker symbols and provides concise
summaries, so you can quickly grasp the most important information.

In today’s fast-paced market, news is everywhere—but most of it is noise. Headlines are flashy, stories are long, and
the real insights are buried.

make smarter investment decisions.
