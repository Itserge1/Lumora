# What's Lumora

Lumora is a financial news summarizer that collects relevant news for different ticker symbols and provides concise
summaries, so you can quickly grasp the most important information.

In today’s fast-paced market, news is everywhere—but most of it is noise. Headlines are flashy, stories are long, and
the real insights are buried.

Some news could even explain sudden market movements, like your favorite stock jumping 7% in a single day.

make smarter investment decisions.
